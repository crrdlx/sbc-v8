Satoshi Bitcoin Converter v8

- bitcoin to USD (or other fiat currency)
- USD (or fiat) to bitcoin
- altcoins supported
- values in BTC, fiat, or sats

The Satoshi Bitcoin Converter (SBC) began in [June of 2013](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=239948.msg2541921#msg2541921). The initial goal was to help juggle between Bitcoin units, decimals, satoshis (sats) and their live USD values. It was also to revert back the other way, from USD to BTC values.

It started as a personal tool, then a website, then an Android app in the [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.satoshi.bitcoin.converter&hl=en_US) (no longer supported), then back to a website format, and finally to a Progressive Web App (PWA).

Though started as a personal tool, the hope is that it has been a small contribution to Bitcoin and has helped some people along the way.
